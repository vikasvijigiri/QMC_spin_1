Ways to Run:
-----------------

1) Go to build folder and relaunch.py inside the build directory. 
   * This will create subdirectories with each parameter values inscribed in the directory. E.g. J_H_0.0 would imply The J_H coupling with value 0.0.
   
2) After the above step one can go to the hirerachial directory to run the code for that particular parameter set, say,  "files/JH_0.0/L4/Beta/30".

3) In this directory, use 'make' command to compile the code this will create an executble "./main".

4) Running this will produce an outputfile containing certain parameters specific to the problem in the code.
